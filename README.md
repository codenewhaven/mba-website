How to build a website

## In Three Easy Steps

Our goal today is to build a website. First, let's prove
how easy it is to make one. Do the following:

    1. Open a text editor.

    2. Paste the code below (Fig 1.1) into the text editor.

    3. Save the code as a file ending in ".html", e.g. my_website.html

Now, open your web browser and press Cmd+O (or go to File->Open,
but why would you do that?) In the file dialog, select the file
you just saved in your text editor.

### Figure 1.1:

    <html>
        <head>
            <title>First of Many</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hi, welcome to my home!</h1>
            <p>I am <b>very</b> happy to see you here.</p>
        </body>
    </html>


## If that sounds difficult, read this:

You might find those three steps to be quite easy. Or, like many people,
you may be wondering what it means to "open a text editor." That's totally
fine. Soon, it will be second nature.

Fortunately, you can learn to code far faster than almost anyone older than you
would be able to. You were born at the perfect time in history, at an inflection
point on the technological growth curve. You grew up surrounded by extremely
advanced technology, and you learned how to use it. You adapted to changes
in standards -- from the start menu, to the home screen. Because you have
seen so much technology around you, you learn new ones quickly.

You have a huge advantage over a massive percentage of the population.
You can learn to code faster than they can, purely because you were
born at the perfect time. *You should take advantage of this opportunity.*

## More detail than three steps

If those three steps don't sound so simple, then some background information
might help:

    1. Open a text editor

Any text editor will suffice. On Mac, there is literally an application
called *TextEdit* that will work perfectly. (Trick: Press *Cmd+Space*
from any screeen on your mac, and start typing "TextEdit" to find the
application via Spotlight.).

At some point, you should download *Sublime Text* to use as your
editor. You can download it here: http://www.sublimetext.com/3

    2. Paste the code below into the text editor

The code in Fig 1.1 is real code for a web page, written in a language
called HTML. Think of HTML as a very barebones programming language,
with exclusively one purpose: to format and display your data. Literally
every website on the Internet is written in HTML at some level. Eventually
you will be able to use other languages to generate the HTML automatically,
but for now you should code it manually.

HTML is based on the concept of *tags*. These are the things in brackets.
`<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<h1>`, `<p>` and `<body>`
are all HTML tags, and order is important, because every tag is *nested*
within another. The `<body>` of the page belongs under the `<html>` of
the page. Every tag represents an element, where the opening tag looks
like `<html>` and the closing tag `</html>`.

You can learn HTML in a single day, because it is very simple. There are
only a few dozen different HTML elements, and once you learn them, you can
make a web page look like almost anything.

    3. Save the code as a file and open it in your web browser

This simply means that you need to go into your web browser, like
Google Chrome or Apple Safari, and open the file you just used
for the HTML code. Any web browser will work because all any
web browser can *render* an HTML page. That means it can transform
the *source code* of an HTML page, like you pasted above, into
a web page.

Go to a popular web page and "view source" to see the HTML that
is rendering the page. In Chrome, you can press Cmd+Alt+U to view
source. In Safari, press Cmd+Comma (Cmd+,) to open the preferences
window, click the "Advanced" tab, and check the box at the bottom,
"show developer menu." Then you can press Cmd+Alt+U to view source.

## Challenge

- Edit the code in Fig 1.1 to display something with a new HTML tag
- Change the title of the page
- View the source of a popular web page and see if you can understand any of it
